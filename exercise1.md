The langauge I chose is Java and like many programming languages it has many tools to help it lint such as pmd,lightrun, and checkstyle. Some test tools for Java are JUnit, TestNG, and Mockito. For building, there's Apache Ant/Maven, and Graddle.
The alternatives to GitHub and Jenkins are a bunch some of them are CircleCI, Pantheon and Cloudbees. I believe that Jenkins is the one to go for scale, and complex projects. GitHub actions is the beginner friendly option, but it's not as flexible as Jenkins. I'm sure the alternatives range in their scalability and ease of use.
Because developer experience, and ease of use is important to me, and may be important to the group of 6 people as well. They may just want to get things off the ground quickly without having to do too much figuring out of things. Since the dev team is so small I think that they should with GitHub actions, and if they need to scale, gitHub can scale. But as the project gets bigger and they need more niche and specific things that gitHub can't, or make it hard to get they can switch to Jenkins. But initially gitHub actions seems like the one to pick. I may change my answer based on how complex the project is and their experience, and abilities with CI. If they're well adept then maybe adopting Jenkins wouldn't be much a challenge to make use of.
